# Python 20 Questions Game

This Python project plays 20 Questions by constructing a binary decision tree from a dataset of objects with binary classifications. The program selects optimal questions to efficiently identify the object a player is thinking of. It supports multiple game rounds without rebuilding the tree.

## Summary
- Builds a binary decision tree from a CSV dataset of objects with binary traits.
- Selects optimal questions to minimize the longest path (balanced search).
- Runs a full 20 Questions game round, guessing the object with yes/no questions.
- Supports dynamic datasets with different numbers of items and categories.
